# fail2ban list of banned IPs

This small shell script gives you a small and quick overview of all currently banned failed2ban IPs

Here are two examples of how it should look:
## Without any IPs banned | Multiple IPs banned

</p>

`Note: Those are only local IPs so I don't mind them being public.`

### Feel free to use this small script or even improve it!

ðŸ’¡Tip:
  You can create a shortcut to the script e.g. in ZSH inside the zshrc file `alias bannedIPs="sh {pathToScript}"`
